h1. Overview

A neurite tracer is a program that extracts the 3D structures of neurons from stacks of electron micrographs of brain tissue, so neuroscientists can infer the connectivity of neurons in a certain volume of the brain without having to manually go through the pictures.

The program works by taking a series of micrographs, and for each picture it traces the contours of neurites (The cellular membranes). Then, the contours are concatenated together into a single 3D models. The resulting models are emitted as a .pov file (Voxels), each model with a different color to ensure they can be told apart.

h1. Goal

This image is from the paper "_3D Segmentation of Neurons from Electron Micrographs_ (PDF)":web.mit.edu/ncthomas/www/RSIpaper.pdf by Nathaniel Thomas (MIT), and shows approximately how the program should behave.

Left is the source image, right is the tracing of its neurites. The source image is a cross section of a ratâ€™s visual cortex taken with an electron microscope. The resolution is 26.4 nm in both the vertical and horizontal directions.

h1. Results

Left is the original micrograph, right is the tracing of its neurites (2D slices only).
